					<h3>The Storyline</h3>
					<p>Alternative interpretation or prequel to the popular movie, <em>I Am Legend</em>. In the not so distant future, 
					more than half of the world's population has contracted a lethal and deforming virus making them threats to 
					non-carriers of the virus.</p>
					
					<p> Society has fallen into a state of dystopia i.e anarchy, frequent purges, and 
					martial law have made the government all but effective in maintaining peace and safety for its citizens. In 
					a last ditch effort to provide refuge for the few remaining, survival stations have been establish 
					throughout each region providing weapons, food, and miscellaneous items necessary to increase survivability. 
					Citizens may make a once per 30-90 day (supply cycle) purchase depending on their region, and my not purchase 
					more than <b>40lbs</b> of supplies per cycle. Due to shortages, limited resupply, and crime it is up to each citizen 
					to strategically purchase items relevant to their geographic area.</p> 
					
					<p>In order to access supplies at a station you must register with a valid form of identification at which point 
					the government will credit each registered citizen <b>$5,000.00</b> for the purchase of goods each supply cycle. Upon 
					successful registration at a station, each member's profile page will provide updates to crime, weather, and 
					political, and socioeconomic data to be used for selecting items appropriate to each locale. Finally, upon 
					purchase of supplies each registered account holder will receive a summary and estimate of their chances of 
					survival based on the items purchased.</p>
